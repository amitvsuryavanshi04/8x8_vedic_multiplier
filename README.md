# 8x8_vedic_multiplier
Overview
This project implements an 8x8 Vedic Multiplier using the Urdhva Tiryakbhyam (Vertically and Crosswise) Sutra, a method derived from ancient Indian Vedic mathematics. This approach provides an efficient and fast method for multiplication, which is particularly advantageous in digital signal processing and other applications requiring rapid arithmetic operations.

Features
Fast Multiplication: The Vedic method significantly reduces the computation time compared to conventional multiplication techniques.
Efficient Hardware Utilization: This implementation optimizes the usage of hardware resources, making it suitable for FPGA and ASIC designs.
Scalable Design: The principles used can be extended to create multipliers of higher bit widths.
## Urdhva Tiryakbhyam Sutra
The Urdhva Tiryakbhyam Sutra translates to "Vertically and Crosswise." This method involves:

Vertical Multiplication: Multiplying the corresponding bits of the multiplicands.
Crosswise Multiplication: Multiplying the crosswise bits and adding them appropriately.
Summation: Summing the vertically and crosswise obtained products to get the final product.
